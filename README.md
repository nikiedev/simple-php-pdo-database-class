## Important

Thanks to all who used my class. It was my first library. Unfortunately, this software is no longer supported. I have no time anymore for this. I use now Codeigniter 4 and Laravel. If you want a clean minimal db library, i recommend you to use <a href='https://github.com/izniburak/pdox'>PDOx</a> instead.
